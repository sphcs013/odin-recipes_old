    <h2>Homemade Fresh Pumpkin Pie</h2>
    <p>This recipe is made from fresh pumpkin, not canned.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy it as much as my family does. Happy Thanksgiving. </p>

    <h5>Shopping List:</h5>
    <h6>Pastry for Single-Crust pie:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening </li>
        <li>3 ½ tablespoons cold water </li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Filling:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce)can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Directions:</h5>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt.
            Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon
            at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons).
            Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.
        </li>
        <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly 
            floured board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, 
            cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. Gently 
            roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie 
            pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, 
            ginger, nutmeg and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. 
            Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 
            inch from the edge comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
